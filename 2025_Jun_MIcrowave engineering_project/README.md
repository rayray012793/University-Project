# Microwave Engineering Lab Projects

This repository contains lab projects from the "Microwave Engineering Lab" course, focusing on RF and microwave circuit design and simulation. The projects explore fundamental concepts such as power division, impedance matching, and antenna design.

## Projects Overview

The following projects are included in this repository:

1. **Wilkinson Power Divider**: Design and simulation of a Wilkinson power divider for equal power splitting with isolation between output ports.
2. **Impedance Matching**: Implementation of impedance matching networks to minimize reflection and maximize power transfer.
3. **Patch Antenna Array**: Design and analysis of a patch antenna array, focusing on beamforming and radiation characteristics for wireless applications.
