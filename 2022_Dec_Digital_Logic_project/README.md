# Verilog Labs - Course Repository

This repository contains all the Verilog labs completed during the course. Each lab is designed to help to understand and apply digital design concepts using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL) commonly used for modeling electronic systems.

## Lab Overview

The labs in this repository cover various fundamental topics in digital design, including combinational logic, sequential circuits, finite state machines, and more. Each lab is organized with clear objectives and includes Verilog code to demonstrate the concepts discussed in the course.
