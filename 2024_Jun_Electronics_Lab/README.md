# Electronics Lab Projects

This repository contains weekly lab projects from an electronics course. The projects cover a variety of electronic circuits and components, such as operational amplifiers (OPAs), NE555 IC, and other essential analog and digital circuits.

## Projects Overview

The following projects are included in this repository:

1. **OPA (Operational Amplifier) Circuit**: Basic operational amplifier circuit design and testing.
2. **OPA Comparator**: Using an operational amplifier as a comparator to compare two voltages.
3. **OPA Adder**: Designing an operational amplifier circuit to perform addition.
4. **Differential Amplifier**: A differential amplifier circuit using operational amplifiers to amplify the difference between two input signals.
5. **Stable Multivibrator**: Design and implementation of a stable multivibrator circuit.
6. **NE555 IC Timer**: A versatile IC used to design timing circuits like pulse width modulation (PWM) and frequency oscillators.
7. **Integrator and Differentiator**: Implementing the integration and differentiation operations using operational amplifiers.
8. **Active Filter**: Design of active low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filters using operational amplifiers.
9. **Power Amplifier**: Designing a power amplifier to drive a load (e.g., speakers or motors).
