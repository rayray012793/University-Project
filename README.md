### Topics Include:
1. **OPA (Operational Amplifier) Circuit**: Basic operational amplifier circuit design and testing.
2. **OPA Comparator**: Using an operational amplifier as a comparator to compare two voltages.
3. **OPA Adder**: Designing an operational amplifier circuit to perform addition.
4. **Differential Amplifier**: A differential amplifier circuit using operational amplifiers to amplify the difference between two input signals.
5. **Stable Multivibrator**: Design and implementation of a stable multivibrator circuit.
6. **Integrator & Differentiator Circuits**: Implementing the integration and differentiation operations using operational amplifiers.
7. **Active Filters (Low-pass, High-pass)**: Design of active low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filters using operational amplifiers.
8. **Power Amplifier**: Designing a power amplifier to drive a load (e.g., speakers or motors).
