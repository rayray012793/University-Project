University Electronics, Web Technology, and Programming Projects
This repository compiles all major lab projects and coursework completed during my university studies. It includes work across multiple domains: electronics circuits, microcontroller applications, web technologies, and various programming languages including C, Verilog, Assembly, and MATLAB.

📡 Live Streaming Platform (Capstone Project):
A live streaming platform built using modern web technologies, inspired by Twitch. Key features include homepage, streamer dashboard, live chat, and real-time video streaming using WebRTC.

🔧 Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express, MySQL

Streaming: WebRTC (ICE, STUN, TURN), initially explored RTMP

Authentication: Session-based login, bcrypt for password hashing

Deployment: Azure virtual machine (VM)

🔊 Signal Capture Projects (MATLAB):
These weekly class projects are focused on signal acquisition and processing using MATLAB.

💻 Verilog Labs:
This folder contains all lab exercises from the digital systems course, written in Verilog.

👨‍💻 Weekly C Programming Exercises:
This folder contains weekly exercises from the programming course, all written in C language.

🧠 Assembly & Verilog Mixed Labs:
Each lab is documented in Word files and includes implementations in both Assembly Language and Verilog.

🧮 8051 Microcontroller Final Project:
This is the final project from the Microcomputer Lab: a fully functional calculator implemented using the 8051 microcontroller.
