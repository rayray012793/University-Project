# Practical Electronic Circuit - Audio Amplifier Lab Projects

This repository contains lab projects from the "Practical Electronic Circuit" course, focusing on audio amplifier design and related circuits. The lab includes projects that explore the fundamentals of audio quality control and amplifier design.

## Projects Overview

The following projects are included in this repository:

1. **Audio Quality Control Circuit**: Design and implementation of a circuit that enhances or adjusts the quality of audio signals.
2. **Class A Amplifier**: Design and testing of a Class A audio amplifier, which provides high-fidelity audio amplification with minimal distortion.
3. **Push-Pull Amplifier**: Design and testing of a Push-Pull amplifier, which uses complementary transistors to amplify both halves of the input signal, providing better efficiency and reducing distortion compared to Class A amplifiers.
