# Live Streaming Platform - Capstone Project

This is a live streaming platform developed as part of our capstone project. The goal of the project was to create a platform that allows users to stream content in real-time, interact with streamers, and engage in live chat. The platform is built using modern web technologies and provides essential live streaming features.
